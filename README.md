# Kubernetes Production Engineering — Companion Files

Official companion files for *Kubernetes Production Engineering* by John Bae (AIDevOps Cloud Native Series #01).
Every file the book refers to as `companion/...` is in this repository's `companion/` folder at the same path.

- Book page: <https://www.aidevops.us/books/kubernetes-production-engineering/>
- The same files as a ZIP: <https://www.aidevops.us/downloads/books/kubernetes-production-engineering/companion.zip>

## Getting the files

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidevops-books/kubernetes-production-engineering-en.git
cd kubernetes-production-engineering-en/companion
```

If you do not use Git, download and extract the ZIP above instead.

## Layout

```text
companion/
├── .github/
├── charts/
├── labs/
├── manifests/
├── scripts/
├── README.md
└── versions.md
```

The lab order, prerequisites and what each file is for are in [`companion/README.md`](companion/README.md). Start there.

## Notes

- Use these files in a learning environment only. Passwords and tokens in the examples are teaching values, not for real services.
- With tool versions other than the book's, output and options may differ slightly.
- To report an error, open an Issue with the book title and edition, chapter, your environment and the steps to reproduce.
